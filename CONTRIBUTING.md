# unic Contributing Guide

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **Sign your commits**: All commits in your pull request must be signed. If you're not sure how to do this, refer to the GitHub documentation for instructions. https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits.

- **Committing changes**: It's acceptable to make multiple small commits as you work on your pull request. This can help keep your changes organized and make it easier to review your work. GitHub will automatically handle these commits before merging them into the main branch.

- **Adding a feature**: If you're adding a new feature, provide a clear and convincing reason as to why it should be added. Ideally, you should open a suggestion issue first and have it approved before working on it.

- **Resolving a bug**: If you're resolving a special issue, add (fix: #xxxx[,#xxx]) to your PR title for a better release log. Replace #xxxx with the issue ID. For example: `fix: resolve buffer overflow (fix #1234)`.

  - Provide a detailed description of the bug in the PR or link to an issue that does.
